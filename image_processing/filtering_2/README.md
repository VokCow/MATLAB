# FILTERING 2

Here trhee filters are applied: a Butterworth filter is applied to the picture in the frequency domain, and both Median and Gaussian 
are used in the spatial domain. 
  * The Butterworth filter provides smotther results than filtering_1 examples when working in the frequency domain. This is because 
  it is not just a geometric shape but follows a function instead:
